# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
In this course, I learned to use unit tests to check valid and invalid inputs. I also ensured that the constructors validated input by checking for nulls and length limits. To continue to ensure that my software is functional and secure, it would be important to maintain discipline to catch errors early and avoid technical debt.
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To incorporate user needs into a program, it is important to make sure that the requirements are fully understood and enforced. In my code, I matched each test and validation to the projectâ€™s listed requirements such as ID length and non-null fields.
# How do I approach designing software?
I approached designing the code in this course by thoroughly validating inputs before allowing the data to be used to practice caution and avoid bias. I would endeavor to maintain this mindset in the future to continue to develop functional and secure software.
